## Creating a new LibreLingo course

Beginners should not be bothered by this page. This page is for those who want to create new courses from scratch, which is for those who have sufficient understanding of the project and how the courses work. Please continue at your own discretion.

**WARNING**: If you just want to make any existing course to be available on your language, please refer to [this page](editing-courses.md) instead and ignore this page. Following this page for editing existing courses can cause invalid data to be created.

[TODO: Add more text on how to create a course from scratch possibly with cli tool etc.]

Before creating a new course, it's recommended that you first contribute to
existing courses. [Learn how to edit or create courses](editing-courses.md). In order to create a
new course and get it published, you'll probably need some technical assistance
as at this stage, several things might not be automated.

You can start off by creating your pull request. I'll get to help with the
pull requests as soon as possible.
