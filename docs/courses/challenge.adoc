= LibreLingo Documentation on Challenge

As they study using LibreLingo, users respond to a series of tasks or questions called **Challenge**s.

Challenges are not configured directly, but link:skill.md#how-skills-are-taught-to-the-user[automatically generated from Skill configuration].

== Challenge order

Within a skill, the order of words and phrases is random, but certain challenge types always come before other types. This is denoted by the _Priority_ values listed under each challenge type. First priority challenges come before second priority challenges, which come before third priority challenges.

== Cards challenge

image::/docs/screenshots/cards-challenge.png[Text asks the user: which of these is "river"?. Below this heading are three cards. Each card contains a Spanish word and corresponding image. In the center the correct choice (rÃ­o) is selected.]

* _Generated from:_ `New words` only
* _Task:_ translation, multiple-choice
* _Direction:_ source \-> target only
* _Properties used:_ `Word`, `Translation`, `Images` -- both of the asked word and of two or three other words in the same skill
* _Mini-dictionary available:_ No
* _Priority_: First

In this challenge type, the user is presented with a word in their source language, and three (four on mobile) cards to choose from. Each card contains a target language word and a matching image, the latter of which functions as a big hint since the user may have never seen this target language word before.

Note that for each card, a random image is selected from the word's `Images` array.

== Short input challenge

image::/docs/screenshots/short-input-challenge.png[Text asks the user to type the word "river" in Spanish. Below this heading is a text box, and underneath that a set of buttons to insert Spanish-specific characters. At right is an image of a river.]

* _Generated from:_ `New words` only
* _Task:_ translation, free-form
* _Direction:_ source \-> target only
* _Properties used:_ `Word`, `Translation`, `Images`
* _Mini-dictionary available:_ Yes
* _Priority_: Second

In this challenge type, the user is presented with a word in their source language, and a text box in which to input the translation into the target language. There is also a random image from the `Images` array on the right, but since this challenge asks for the target language, the image does not give the user any additional information. If the user does need a hint, the mini-dictionary is available for this challenge.

== Options challenge

image::/docs/screenshots/options-challenge.png[Text asks the user which one of the options is "Let's go to the beach!". Below this question are three Spanish sentences with radio buttons to their left.]

* _Generated from:_ `Phrases` only
* _Task:_ translation, multiple-choice
* _Direction:_ source \-> target only
* _Properties used:_ `Phrase`, `Translation` both of the asked phrase and two other phrases in the same skill
* _Mini-dictionary available:_ No
* _Priority_: First

In this challenge type, the user is presented with a phrase in their source language, and three options from which they must choose the correct translation into the target language. There are no hints available.

== Chips challenge

image::/docs/screenshots/chips-challenge.png[Text instructs the user to translate the phrase "Let's go to the beach!". At the bottom of the image, there is a group of draggable Spanish words.]

* _Generated from:_ `Phrases` only
* _Task:_ translation, set of words provided
* _Direction:_ Both directions: source \-> target, target \-> source
* _Properties used:_
 ** If source \-> target: `Phrase`, `Translation`, `Alternative translations`; `Translation` and `Alternative translations` of other phrases anywhere in the course
 ** If target \-> source: `Translation`, `Phrase`, `Alternative versions`; `Phrase` and `Alternative versions` of other phrases anywhere in the course
* _Mini-dictionary available:_ Yes
* _Priority_: Third

In this challenge type, the user is presented with a phrase in one language and a set of words in the other language. This set will always include all words of the `Translation` field. The user's task is to use this words as "building blocks" to create _any_ acceptable translation for the phrase they've been presented with.

The mini-dictionary is available to give hints about individual words but there are no hints about grammar or sentence structure.

The chips will never include exact duplicates of each other.

== Listening challenge

image::/docs/screenshots/listening-challenge.png[Text instructs the user: "Type what you hear". Below this heading is a text box, and underneath that a set of buttons to insert Spanish-specific characters.]

* _Generated from:_ `New words` and `Phrases`
* _Task:_ transcription
* _Direction:_ N/A, target language only
* _Properties used:_ `Word` or `Phrase`
* _Mini-dictionary available:_ No
* _Priority_: Second

In this challenge type, the user is played audio of a word or phrase in the target language, and is presented with a text box to transcribe the audio (still in the target language). The user can re-listen to the audio, if necessary.
