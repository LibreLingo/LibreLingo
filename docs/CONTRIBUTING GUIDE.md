The project is in a very early stage right now, so you might not be able to contribute right away. Your work will be released in this GitHub repository and you will show up as a contributor here.


### Development and other forms of contribution

Check the latest **Development documentation** is available on [Read the Docs](https://librelingo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This project has 2 main components

* Frontend, implemented using Svelte
* Course editor, implemented using Django

The site is statically built and hosted on GitHub pages, therefore there's no real "backend" or API.
